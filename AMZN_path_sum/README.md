## Path Sum
Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer
`targetSum`, return `true` if the tree has
a **root-to-leaf** path such that adding up all the values
along the path equals `targetSum`.

A **leaf** is a node with no children

### Sample Input
```
                5
        4               8
  11                13      4
7   2                         1

targetSum = 22
```

### Sample Output
```
True (5 -> 4 -> 11 -> 2)
```
