## Invert Binary Tree
Given the `root` of a binary tree, invert the tree, and
return its root  

Ex:
```
      3                    3
  2       8     ->     8       2
7   6   5   1        1    5  6    7 
```

### Solution Input
```
root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
```

### Solution Output
```
[4,7,2,9,6,3,1]
```
